Description:
This program will take your recently listened to songs on Spotify
and store them in a database so you can keep track of your own 
listens! As well as it keeps a database of every individual song
and artist that you've listened to! Though you may need to do some 
manually inputting data for things like song lengths or album names
(still work in progress)


Requirements:
python installed
Need to enter the create table instructions into sqlite3
in the directory of the db file in this folder


Usage:
This script uses the contents of the input.txt file in order to 
put data into your database
Copy paste the large table of recently listened to songs from the
statsforspotify website, THIS INCLUDES THE HEADER FOR EACH COLOUMN
Paste the result into the input.txt file, then run the script.
Feel free to delete the contents of the input.txt file when done,
or just replace them on your next usage
